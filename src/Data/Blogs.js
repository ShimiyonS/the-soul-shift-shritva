            { type: "paragraph", text: "A few months ago, I wrote an open note to all those holding space for healing – doctors, energy workers, coaches, physiotherapists – anyone offering their presence in service to another’s transformation." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Today, I want to write a note to those who are <b>seeking</b> healing." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Every practitioner has once been a seeker. We have all walked through the fire. And in many ways, we still do. Healing is not a linear path. Those who now hold space for others have stood in the very place you are standing – uncertain, tender, yearning." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "And those who reach out for healing need to know this:" },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Everyone who facilitates healing for you in some way always wishes good for you. While many could come across as insensitive or non-compassionate, here are often many unseen reasons behind that – timing, energetic boundaries, personal capacity, and sometimes aspects that are unexplainable. While your experience is always valid and deserves to be honored, it is equally important to recognize that practitioners are not the Source of healing. We are conduits – vessels – for something greater: call it God, the Universe, Spirit, or Life itself." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Yes, information is abundant. Every modality brings its own language, tools, and maps. And, most of the time, the practitioners are open to listening. But <b>when you start imposing your views and perceptions on the practitioner, when suggestions become directive,</b> when the seeker insists on how the session should be done or what outcome must happen, the boundary is trespassed. That becomes control – not collaboration." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "<b>Healing requires trust.</b> Trust does not mean blind faith – it means entering a space of co-creation, where both the seeker and the practitioner respect the sacredness of the process. When control replaces trust, healing becomes strained. When openness leads the way, miracles are possible." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "While I agree this happens because of your need to feel healed, understand that healing, at the end of the day, lies in your hands. We just facilitate only as much as you allow us to do. Just like you would not walk into a doctor’s clinic and dictate a surgery that is not needed, in healing work too – suggestion is welcome, but imposition is not. The difference is subtle. Feel into it." },
            { type: "subheading", text: "On Inner Wounds and Reflection" },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Another point that I want to talk about is about the inner wounds. If you feel offended with the words of a practitioner, understand two things" },
            { type: "ul", items: ["You are getting irritated with that part of you which does not like something", "You are seeing a reflection of what needs to be addressed"] },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: "Instead of telling the practitioner, “This is a red flag for me,” or “You are invalidating me,” try and understand what the person is trying to communicate. Consider that the message might have come from a place of compassion. If in doubt, talk it through." },
            { type: "subheading", text: "On Free Sessions and Energetic Exchange" },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Many practitioners offer them with genuine love and service. But it is important to know: receiving something freely does not mean bypassing the sacred exchange. Clinging to a practitioner until you “feel healed” can create energetic dependency – and this often causes more harm than good. Healing cannot be outsourced. It must be claimed." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Healing is a relationship. Not a transaction. Not an entitlement. So do not take the practitioners for granted." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Healing cannot be outsourced. It comes from within.  It is welcomed with presence. Lived. Integrated. No one – not even the most gifted healer, coach, or guide – can do the deep inner work for you." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "They can:" },
            { type: 'ul', items: ["Support you with tools", "Hold a safe, sacred space", "Activate energy, shift blocks", "Reflect truths you may not yet see"] },
            { type: "paragraph", text: " But they cannot make you integrate the shift. They can’t force you to choose differently. They cannot live the transformation on your behalf." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "To outsource healing means unconsciously handing over responsibility to someone else – hoping they will “fix” everything. But true healing is not passive. It is a return to inner ownership.To outsource healing means unconsciously handing over responsibility to someone else – hoping they will “fix” everything. But true healing is not passive.

            { type: "paragraph", text: "No one is wrong. Everyone is responding from their level of awareness, their wounds, their wiring. And when we understand this, compassion enters the room." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Do not personalize everything. Nothing is personal here. Just observe – as a seeker or as a practitioner, and then communicate. Never disappear on someone – that never solves anything. If you disappear on someone because some wound of yours got triggered, you will find someone else who will trigger the same wound until you face it and understand it." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "So, stop controlling – there is no need to dominate. There is nothing to be afraid. Take charge of your life, your healing. Communicate your needs very clearly and allow the guidance to flow. If you have doubts, ask the practitioner for clarity. Be assertive and constructive, but never be controlling or dominating. And, remember, nobody but you are responsible for your healing." },

            { type: "paragraph", text: "And above all – remember: healing is not something that is done to you. It is something that happens through you." },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Practitioners can offer guidance, tools, wisdom, and even create the most supportive environment – but whether you, as a seeker, actually receives it, acts on it, or changes… is entirely up to you." },

            { type: "paragraph", text: "You all are in the field of healing because we have a deep compassion for humanity. But where does that disappear as soon as you start experiencing financial inflow or gain more practice or become popular or xyz reason? Why does the compassion get replaced with presumptions and assumptions? Why do you not let the clients/patients express themselves? Why do you feel that they are trying to overpower you?" },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "People come to you mostly because they want to be heard. Many a time, talking with a good listener itself relieves half the issue of the person who comes. Touch your heart and check with yourself. Are you a good listener? Are you listening or are you hearing?" },
            { type: "paragraph", text: "Yes, they will cry. They could break down. They might be so helpless that they just need the assurance and reassurance that things could work out in their favour. Could you give them that? If things are looking gloomy, could you adopt a constructive way to share it?" },
            { type: " paragraph", text: "Any person seeks healing in any form so that he/she could feel stable. All of them have an underlying element of anxiety they carry. Never ever tell someone who is experiencing anxiety the following" },

They don’t do it intentionally.", "Remember that you could handle it the way you wish – one small change in the way you respond – a teeny-weeny bit of compassion and a constructive response could give them a sense of hope and make them feel a little better. They might get the inner strength and hope that they could move through whatever they’re experiencing a little easier.", "Do not slam the door on their face – do not block them or ignore them. Blocking or ignoring someone is a sign of you feeling helpless – it is not setting boundaries, but it is you not being able to maintain boundaries with ease because you are avoiding facing your demons – you are denying that you could be feeling like that some time."] },

            { type: "paragraph", text: "Yes, you all have learnt things – you all carry experiences but that doesn’t give anyone the power to generalize anything. Let go of all assumptions and presumptions. Allow yourself to listen. Let every person you meet be a fresh canvas – even if they are meeting you for the nth time. Never project your thoughts and feelings onto them. Hold space with compassion. Compassion brings detachment. Compassion brings synarchy. Compassion keeps and maintains boundaries with ease. Be compassionate." },
